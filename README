Libtorrent-reputation is a plugin for libtorrent-rasterbar which implements tracking a peer's upload/download volume across multiple swarms. Reputation can be provided via a common intermediary so that even peers who have never directly connected before can establish standing with each other.

For details on the reputation scheme, see https://github.com/ssiloti/bep-persistent-credit/blob/master/one-hop-rep.rst

libtorrent-reputation requires the following dependencies to build:

libtorrent-rasterbar >= 1.1
sqlite 3
boost >= 1.47

Example usage:

namespace lt = libtorrent;

lt::session ses;
lt::reputation_handle reputation;
boost::shared_ptr<lt::lt_identify_plugin> identify_plugin = boost::make_shared<lt::lt_identify_plugin>();
ses.add_extension(boost::shared_ptr<lt::plugin>(identify_plugin));
reputation = create_reputation_plugin(*identify_plugin, <client_configuration_directory>, <user_password>);
ses.add_extension(reputation.reputation_plugin);

An sqlite databse will be created in the provided configuration directory with the private key encrypted by the given password. The password can be blank if the user has not configured one.
